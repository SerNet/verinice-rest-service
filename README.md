# verinice REST service

This project which provides a
[REST](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) service
for a verinice database. The verinice REST service is a [Spring
Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) application build with
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

## Modules

The project consist of several modules to separate concerns. This section
describes the modules of the project.

### verinice-interface

Module _verinice-interface_ contains classes and interfaces which are shared by all other
modules.

### verinice-persistence

Module _verinice-persistence_ contains objects to access data from the database and the
Java Persistence API (JPA) configuration.

### verinice-service

Module _verinice-service_ contains a Java API of the service.

### verinice-rest

Module _verinice-rest_ contains the REST controller for the service.


## Build
To build the application run

	mvn install

you can then install the *./verinice-rest/target/verinice-rest-xxx.jar*.

If want to start SpringBoot in development you can then run

	mvn -pl verinice-rest spring-boot:run

assuming you have proper database setup up, see [application.properties](verinice-rest/src/main/resources/application.properties).

## Testing
Integration tests are written in python using [Requests][]
and standard python [unittest][py-unittest].

Since no maven plugin has been found which could start spring-boot and run the
test against a custom database a shell script has been written to batch several
steps. To run the integration tests execute

	./integration-test

The script uses the following variables

- `VERINICEDBSERVER` the database server URL
- `VERINICEDB` the database name to connect to at $VERINICEDBSERVER
- `VERINICEUSER` the user which spring should use for the database (has to exists)
- `VERINICEPASSWORD` the password for the database `$VERINICEUSER`
- `VERINICEDUMP` the location to a database dumb which shall be used to recreate the `$VERINICEDB`
- `SPRINGDELAY`  time to sleep before running the tests to give spring time to boot

i.â€¯e. to run the test against a custom database with a special user run

	VERINICEDB=databasename VERINICEUSER=user VERINICEPASSWORD=password ./integration-test

## Documentation
The Rest-API is documented using the spring-swagger-framework. To view the
documentation run the application and visit
[localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html](localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html).

## Releasing
To release a new version (here 0.1 is assumed) of the project, you should

1. Initially checkout the `develop` branch.
2. Create a new branch `release/0.1`

		git checkout -b release/0.1

3. Until QA gives green light:
	1. Update project version using maven.

			mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.1-beta1

	2. Commit, tag and push the release branch with updated version.

			git commit -a
			git push origin release/0.1
			git tag -s 0.1-beta1
			git push origin 0.1-beta1

	3. Checkout the beta tag.

			git checkout 0.1-beta1

	4. Do a deployment build.

			mvn clean package

	5. Put deployment to QA.
	6. If QA fails, fix bugs onto branch `feature/0.1` and jump back to 3.1.
4. Update the project version.

		mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.1
		git commit -a
		git push origin release/0.1

5. Merge the release branch to master and tag.

		git checkout master
		git merge --no-ff release/0.1
		git tag -s 0.1

6. Checkout the tag.

		git checkout 0.1

7. Do a deployment build.

		mvn clean package

8. Release deployment.

9. Merge the release branch to develop to get bugfixes.

		git co develop
		git merge --no-ff release/0.1
		git push origin develop

## Troubleshooting
### Could not resolve dependencies
If you get an error like this

	[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project verinice-rest: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.verinice:verinice-rest:jar:0.3: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.verinice:verinice-interface:jar:0.3, org.verinice:verinice-service:jar:0.3: Failure to find org.verinice:verinice-interface:jar:0.3 in https://repo.spring.io/libs-release was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of spring-releases has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]

you have to run

	mvn install

before.
